# PRODIGY_SD_01
# Temperature Conversion Program

## Overview

This Python program provides a simple and effective way to convert temperatures between three common units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program prompts the user to input a temperature value along with its unit of measurement, then performs the necessary conversions to the other two units and displays the results.

## Features

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin**: Converts a temperature given in Celsius to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin**: Converts a temperature given in Fahrenheit to both Celsius and Kelvin.
- **Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit**: Converts a temperature given in Kelvin to both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user is prompted to choose the unit of the input temperature and to enter the temperature value.
2. **Conversion Functions**: The program utilizes conversion functions to calculate the equivalent temperatures in the other two units.
3. **Output**: The converted temperatures are displayed to the user with two decimal precision.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `temperature_conversion.py` file in a Python environment.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the prompts to input the temperature value and select the unit of measurement.
5. The program will output the equivalent temperatures in the other two units.

## Example

If you enter a temperature of `25` degrees Celsius, the program will display:

```
25.00°C is equivalent to 77.00°F and 298.15K
```

## Code Structure

- **Conversion Functions**: Separate functions for each conversion (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
- **Main Function**: Handles user interaction and displays results based on user input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
